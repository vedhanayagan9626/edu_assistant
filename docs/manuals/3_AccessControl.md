# EduAssistant: Access Control & Governance

This manual details the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Departmental Governance models used in EduAssistant.

---

## 🎭 1. User Personas & Permissions

The system is built on three distinct authority tiers, each designed to fulfill specific institutional needs.

### 👑 Administrator (System Governance)
- **Scope**: Full system-wide visibility.
- **Capabilities**:
    - Manage institutional Departments.
    - Create and update User accounts.
    - Link Staff to multiple departments.
    - Monitor overall system health and subject growth.

### 👤 Staff (Course Management)
- **Scope**: Department-specific authority.
- **Capabilities**:
    - Manage Subject details for assigned departments.
    - Upload, process, and delete PDF course materials.
    - Monitor AI readiness for their subjects.
    - *Note*: Staff can only manage subjects in departments explicitly assigned to them by an Admin.

### 🎓 Student (Knowledge Access)
- **Scope**: Subject-specific interaction.
- **Capabilities**:
    - Access subjects within their ONE assigned department.
    - Engage in RAG-powered chat with authorized materials.
    - *Note*: Students are strictly isolated from any department other than their own.

## 🏢 2. Structural Governance (Departments)
Departments act as the primary security containers in EduAssistant.

- **Isolation**: A "Department" is more than a label; it is a hard security boundary.
- **Assignment Logic**:
    - **Multi-Department Staff**: Allows professors who teach across disciplines (e.g., Math and CS) to manage subjects in both arenas.
    - **Single-Department Students**: Simplifies the student experience and ensures data relevance.

## 🔐 3. Backend Security Enforcement
Security is not just a UI feature. The backend reinforces control through:
- **JWT Verification**: Every request requires a valid, role-embedded token.
- **Interceptor Middleware**: Flask decorators (`@staff_required`, `@admin_required`) block unauthorized API access.
- **Query Filtering**: Database joins ensure that a user can *never* retrieve an ID that doesn't belong to their authorized set.
