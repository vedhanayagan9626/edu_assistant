# EduAssistant: Technical Stack Reference

This document provides a comprehensive breakdown of the core technologies powering the EduAssistant platform.

---

## 🎨 1. Frontend: The Modern Interface
The frontend is built for speed, responsiveness, and a premium user experience.

- **React 19**: Leveraging the latest features of React for efficient rendering and state management.
- **Vite**: Serving as the lightning-fast build tool and development server.
- **Tailwind CSS 4.0**: A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid, consistent, and highly customizable UI design.
- **Framer Motion**: Powering fluid animations and transitions that give the dashboard its premium feel.
- **Lucide React**: A clean and consistent icon set used throughout the application.

## ⚙️ 2. Backend: The Intelligent Core
The backend is a robust Python-based API that manages data, security, and AI orchestration.

- **Flask**: A lightweight and flexible WSGI web application framework.
- **SQLAlchemy**: The powerful ORM used to interact with the relational database (PostgreSQL/SQLite).
- **Alembic**: Handling database migrations to ensure schema consistency.
- **Flask-JWT-Extended**: Providing secure, industry-standard authentication via JSON Web Tokens.

## 🧠 3. AI & RAG Infrastructure
The centerpiece of EduAssistant is its Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

- **Google Gemini API**: Utilized as the primary Large Language Model (LLM) for high-quality instruction following and generation.
- **ChromaDB**: An open-source vector database used for storing and querying subject-specific document embeddings.
- **Sentence-Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)**: The embedding model used to represent text chunks in a 384-dimensional vector space.
- **LangChain**: Employed for intelligent text splitting and document processing workflows.

## 📁 4. Data Layer & Persistence
- **PostgreSQL**: Serving as the primary relational database for production (SQLite for local development).
- **Chroma Persistence**: Local filesystem persistence for vector collections, ensuring AI knowledge remains intact across restarts.
- **Secure File Storage**: Structured directory system for managing uploaded PDFs and course materials.
