## 🏗️ 2. System Architecture

EduAssistant follows a modern Client-Server architecture with a specialized AI service layer.

### RAG Workflow
1. **Document Ingestion**: Staff upload PDF documents for specific subjects.
2. **Preprocessing**: Documents are split into optimized chunks using LangChain.
3. **Embedding**: Chunks are converted into vector embeddings.
4. **Vector Storage**: Embeddings are stored in subject-specific ChromaDB collections.
5. **Retrieval**: When a student asks a question, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks.
6. **Generation**: Retrieved context is sent to Gemini to generate accurate, source-backed answers.

## 🔐 3. Access Control (Department-Based)

The system implements a multi-tier Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) synchronized with Departmental boundaries.

- **Admins**:
    - Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for Users and Departments.
    - Assign Staff to **multiple departments**.
    - Assign Students to a **single department**.
- **Staff**:
    - Manage Subjects within their assigned departments.
    - Upload and process course materials (PDFs).
    - AI-managed subject collections (ChromaDB cleanup on deletion).
- **Students**:
    - Dashboard access limited *strictly* to subjects within their assigned department.
    - Interactive AI chat sessions based on uploaded subject documentation.
